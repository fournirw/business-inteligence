```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Ex: [Indeed Jobs Webpage] <https://www.indeed.com/jobs/> example. 

```{r indeed}
robotstxt::paths_allowed(
  paths= "/jobs/",
  domain = "https://www.indeed.com"
)

```

Given that this returned 'TRUE' , you are allowed to scrape this webpage 
 
```{r bls_scrape}
robotstxt::paths_allowed(
  paths = "/emp/",
  domain = "https://www.bls.gov/"
)

req = httr2::request("https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm"
    ) |>
  httr2::req_user_agent("AN ISA 401 Bot from Miami University") |>
  httr2::req_perform()

bls_webpage = resp |> httr2::resp_body_raw() |> rvest::read_html()
bls_webpage

```
